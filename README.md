# 🤝 Ecosystem Synergy Agent

**Ecosystem Synergy Agent** is a modular AI agent designed to help Web3 founders discover mission-aligned, technically compatible, and community-synergistic partners across the decentralized ecosystem. Built as part of the OnlyFounders AI Hackathon, this agent brings intelligent ecosystem mapping to the onchain fundraising process.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

In decentralized fundraising, discovering strategic partners like DAOs, protocols, or tooling platforms is critical but time-consuming. The Ecosystem Synergy Agent automates this discovery process using AI and real-time knowledge of Web3 infrastructure. It helps founders identify organizations that can amplify their project’s growth based on shared values, overlapping technology stacks, and audience compatibility.

This agent is privacy-preserving, locally processable, and designed for integration into multi-agent environments like OnlyFounders.

## 🧬 Sample Use Case

**Input:**
> "We’re building a decentralized learning DAO that rewards users with verifiable credentials. Our tech stack includes Ceramic, Ethereum smart contracts, and IPFS."

**Output:**
- **LearnWeb3 DAO** (DAO): Aligned mission in decentralized education and skill onboarding.
- **Gitcoin** (Funding Platform): Provides grants and community support for open education.
- **Ceramic Network** (Protocol): Seamless identity and credentialing compatibility.
- **Lens Protocol** (Social Layer): Ideal for showcasing learning achievements socially.
